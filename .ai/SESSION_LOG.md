# Session Log

## 2026-08-01 — Session 3: Version control, project memory, baseline commits

### Work performed
- Established git repo (`main`), `.gitignore`, commit workflow rules
- Created `.ai/` project memory (CURRENT_STATE, NEXT_STEPS, DECISIONS, ROADMAP,
  ARCHITECTURE, SESSION_LOG) + milestone checkpoint `CHECKPOINT_20260801_0036`
- Created `README.md` (referenced by `pyproject.toml` — packaging would fail without it)
- Fixed packaging: explicit `[tool.setuptools] packages` (stray artifact dirs
  broke `pip install -e .`); ruff config sections corrected
- Fixed lint debt across pre-existing modules (64+ findings: F401, E501, I001,
  W292, F841) incl. latent bug — `count_message_tokens` used but never imported
  in `tokenopt/pipeline/compressor.py`
- Committed all existing work in 9 logical commits
- Verified: 23 tests pass, ruff clean, editable install works

### Context (prior sessions)
- Session 2 (previous chat): implemented `local_client.py`, `factory.py`,
  package `__init__` files, 23 tests; fixed invalid TOML in pyproject,
  added numpy dependency; installed missing deps; updated SESSION_BACKUP.md
- Session 1 (original build): Phase 1 core modules (config, utils, pipeline
  stages, observability, OpenAI/Anthropic clients)
